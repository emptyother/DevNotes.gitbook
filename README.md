# About

_Most_ of this is cut-and-paste info from Stackexchange or other pages. _Some_ of it is **personal knowledge**. When I'm copying text from others it is because I don't trust the information to stay until the next time I need it. Internet change all the time. 

This also means that a lot of info here isn't always up to date. Check the source links if they still exists.

Some of it is written in Norwegian. Sorry about that. I might translate it eventually.
