## Creative Gigaworks T20 series II \(Desktop Speakers\)

14 watts RMS per channel \(2 channels\) • Frequency: 50 Hz ~ 20 kHz

Settings: 24 bit, 48000 Hz, loudness equalization Turning off loudness eq. changed nothing. Setting bit depth and sample rate down to 16 bit, 44100 Hz or up to 24 bit, 192k Hz changed nothing.

Low freq. range test Result: 50 Hz

High frequency range test Result: 14k Hz \(might be my own ears\)

Alias Sound Test A slight leveling in sound \(i supposed thats the "aliasing"?\)

## Headset \(Logitech G35\)

Settings: 16 bit, 44100 Hz, disabled software surround and hardware surround button

Low freq. range test Result: 20 Hz

High frequency range test Result: 14k Hz again Note: Ears began jittering at 15k Hz... What was that?

Alias Sound Test Sound drasticly "leveled" and a lot sharper.

## Fun facts

```text
• Mosquito sound is in range of 17k-20k Hz
• This also turned into my own hearing test. Humans can hear between 20-20k Hz.
```
